# ðŸš€ AeroGuard - Predictive Maintenance System

**AeroGuard** is a machine learning-based predictive maintenance system designed to estimate the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of aircraft engines using NASAâ€™s CMAPSS dataset. The system helps anticipate engine failures in advance, enabling proactive maintenance and enhancing safety and operational efficiency.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

AeroGuard provides a complete data-driven pipeline to process engine sensor data, identify key indicators of degradation, and forecast how many operational cycles remain before maintenance is required. It offers both a backend predictive model and a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

## ðŸ§  Techniques & Methodology

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Preprocessing
- Reads and processes the CMAPSS FD001 dataset (`train`, `test`, and `RUL` files).
- Computes Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for training data using each engine's max cycle.
- Aligns the last cycle of each test engine with its true RUL.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Feature Selection
- Trains a **Random Forest Regressor** to assess the importance of sensor and operational features.
- Automatically selects the **top 10 most relevant features** based on learned importance scores.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Model Architecture
- Uses a **hybrid ensemble** approach combining:
  - **Random Forest Regressor** (optimized with bootstrap, limited depth, and square-root feature sampling).
  - **XGBoost Regressor** (with controlled depth and learning rate).
- Final prediction is the **average of both model outputs**.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Prediction Correction
- Applies a fixed **correction factor (23.66)** to adjust for historical model overestimation.
- Ensures no negative RUL predictions by clipping at zero.

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

The system calculates and displays the following performance metrics:

- **RÂ² Score** â€“ Measures prediction fit to actual RUL values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** â€“ Penalizes larger errors.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** â€“ Average magnitude of prediction errors.

A line plot visualizes **Actual vs Predicted RUL**, and engine-wise results are shown in a tabular format.
